# LLM Usage Report

## Project: Gait-Based Person Identification System

This document describes how Large Language Models (LLMs) were used during the development of this project.

---

## 1. Project Planning and Structure

The LLM was used to:

* Design the overall project architecture.
* Suggest a clear folder structure for:

  * Raw accelerometer and gyroscope data
  * Merged datasets
  * Processed features
  * Unknown data for prediction
* Define the step-by-step pipeline:

  1. Data merging
  2. Windowing
  3. Feature extraction
  4. Data augmentation
  5. Model training
  6. Prediction

---

## 2. Data Processing Guidance

The LLM helped in:

* Understanding how to merge accelerometer and gyroscope data.
* Explaining and implementing sliding window techniques.
* Designing feature extraction methods from sensor signals.
* Structuring the preprocessing scripts.

---

## 3. Data Augmentation Logic

The LLM was used to:

* Suggest augmentation techniques for sensor data.
* Explain how augmentation increases dataset size.
* Help implement augmentation scripts.

---

## 4. Machine Learning Model Development

The LLM assisted in:

* Selecting suitable models for gait identification.
* Writing training scripts.
* Explaining model evaluation metrics.
* Debugging model errors.

---

## 5. Error Debugging and Code Fixing

The LLM was used to:

* Identify and fix runtime errors.
* Resolve import and dependency issues.
* Suggest improvements to code structure.
* Optimize scripts for better performance.

---

## 6. Documentation and Project Files

The LLM helped in:

* Writing `README.md`.
* Creating `requirements.txt`.
* Preparing project documentation.
* Structuring explanation files for submission.

---

## 7. Conceptual Understanding

The LLM was used as a learning assistant to:

* Explain windowing in time-series data.
* Clarify feature extraction concepts.
* Understand the complete data flow of the system.

---

## Summary

The LLM was primarily used as:

* A coding assistant
* A debugging tool
* A documentation helper
* A conceptual learning guide

It was not used to generate the dataset or automatically build the full system. The model development, data processing, and testing were performed by the user with guidance from the LLM.
